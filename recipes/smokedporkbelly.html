    <h1>Smoked Pork Belly</h1>
        <img src="../images/smokedporkbelly.png" alt="aluminum pan with cubed smoked pork belly" height="410" width="410">
        <p>When ever there is a family gathering I am asked to make my smoked pork belly.  It's nothing fancy
            but it sure gets everyone talking and wanting more!
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 slab of pork belly</li>
                <li>1 12 oz honey mustard (generic brand is fine)</li>
                <li>1 container of your favorite seasons </li>
                <li>1 18 oz container of your favorite bbq sauce (I use Sweet Baby Ray's)</li>
                <li>1 12 oz bag of brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 12 oz Frank's Red Hot sauce</li>
                <li>Your favorite wood/pellets</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat your smoker to 225 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Unpackage your pork belly and pat dry.</li>
                <li>Coat all sides of the pork belly with the honey mustard. This makes the dry seasoning stick to the meat.</li>
                <li>Evenly coat all sides of the pork belly with your seasoning.  I use the green label Traeger seasoning.</li>
                <li>Add your favorite wood/pellets. I like to use apple with a little mesquite, or cherry.</li>
                <li>Place your pork belly on the top shelf with the fat side pointed down. You're going to
                leave the pork belly smoking for 3 hours.</li>
                <li>After 3 hours, remove the pork belly.</li>
                <li>Add the bbq sauce, brown sugar, and Frank's Red Hot sauce over the pork belly. No need
                mix the ingrediants, they will melt and mix in the heat.</li>
                <li>Cover and seal the pork belly and replace into the smoker for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove the cover and place the pork belly back into the smoker for up to 1 more hour.</li>
                <li>Remove the container and cut the pork belly into cubes, roughly 2 inches, and serve!</li>
            </ol>
