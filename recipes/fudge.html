        <p>So, self proclaimed "World's Greatest" fudge. My uncle Mike used to make the best fudge that had everyone asking for more and the recipe! 
        My uncle never gave the recipe out, not even to his wife or kids. He would always laugh and say the same thing every time, "It's very easy, so simple!"
        I miss that man very much. To honor his memory I had to go on the scavenger hunt to find the "World's Greatest" fudge, recipe. It was creamy, thick, and buttery.
        The perfect balance of texture, sweetness, and chocolatey-ness. My research led me to the old Hershey's recipe book from the 1930's. Here's hoping this is it!
